## Technologies
I used `React.Js`,`Wouter`,`ChakraUI`,`Framer Motion` ...

## Setup
- Download or clone the repository
- Install dependecies : `yarn install`
- Run : `yarn run dev`
- Build : `yarn run build`
- Build Preview : `yarn run preview`

## Approach
We used react.js for the creation of functional and reusable components . This app is designed by the FrontendMentor platform so from my side I had to replicate the design adding the essential features of an application, both the routing, as components, layout, animations, functionalities.

-The project is initialized from the scafolding provided by Vite which has rollup, esBuild, ESmodules etc.

- The routers were configured with the WOUTER library which is a library similar to react-router with the difference that it has a much smaller bundle size.

-The layout is made based on grid and flex box using the Chakra UI component library which provides a much faster layout because it uses css in js, so it is not necessary to use a style sheet.

- It has some animations which are made with the Framer Motion library as it has full compatibility with ChakraUI.

[MovieStreamAPP] is still in progress. `Version 1.0.5` will be out soon.
